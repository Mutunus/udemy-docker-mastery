ideally your containers should be immutatble and ephemeral i.e. you should not change them once they are up and they should be temporary

but what if you have a database that you want to preserve after you destroy and re-create a container? data can be made persitent by using Volumes or Bind Mounts


Volumes

Keep data in a defined directory on the host machine. This means that even if you stop and remove the container, your data will be preserved. 

see all volumes
docker volume ls

docker container run -d --name mysql -e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=True -v VOLUME_NAME:/var/lib/mysql mysql
giving a volume a unique name helps identify it when running the docker volume ls command.


Bind Mounting

Map a host directory to a container directory to give container access to host files/directories

docker container run -it --rm -p 100:80 -v $(pwd):PATH_IN_CONTAINER CONTAINER_NAME
$(pwd) = print current directory. you could manually enter the host path to the directory you want, but this is easier.
PATH_IN_CONTAINER = the file path defined in the container.
