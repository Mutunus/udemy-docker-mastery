if you want to allow your pods to communicate externally other resources you need to create a service.

create a service
k expose deployment DEPLOYMENT_NAME --port PORT
this will create a ClusterIP service that will have an IP assigned to it. this will allow you to communicate with the deployment using the assigned 
service IP and the port you exposed. This will only open up communication between deployments on the same machine, not to external requests i.e. a LAN.

list all services
k get service

test exposed service port
curl SERVICE_IP:SERVICE_PORT

k expose deployment DEPLOYMENT_NAME --port PORT --name SERVICE_NAME --type NodePort
creates a NodePort service which will have a static IP assigned to it. this will allow you to communicate with the deployment from an exteranal source.

k expose deployment DEPLOYMENT_NAME --port PORT --name SERVICE_NAME --type LoadBalancer
exposes the service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer
